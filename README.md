# SCPCBR Manifest Generator

This tool is used to support and debugging purposes. This loops through every file in the given game directory and finds the unique MD5 hash of the file. The program will output a debug file to your desktop named "SCPCBR_DEBUG.txt". When this file is uploaded to support, they can use this file to compare your game files against the correct game files to find any discrepancies.
